Quiz

- What is the difference between var and let?
		Var can be reassigned and can be redeclared. Also, var variables are scoped a function. With let, you can reassign but you cannot redeclare.  Let is strictly block scoped.
- What is the difference between var and const?
		Again, var can be reassigned and redeclared. Const  cannot be reassigned or redeclared.
- What is the difference between let and const?
		let and const are scoped to the code block.
		The main difference between let and const are: let can be reassigned  while const cannot be reassigned.
		Both cannot be redeclared.
- What is hoisting?
		When using var and your code is compiled, the variable declaration [portions] run before initialization.
		When using variable declarations made with the let keyword, they are not hoisted and will not run first. The declaration will not  run separately from the initialization.
